# Vernam Cipher in Python
A high performance vernam cipher encryption in Python for encoding and decoding plain texts to cipher text. Used in private messaging, cookies and more.

Code available in Vcrypt.py above.

Vernam cipher, created by Gilber Sandford Vernam (3 April 1890 â€“ 7 February 1960), is a symmetrical stream cipher in which the plaintext is combined with a random or pseudorandom stream of data (the "keystream") of the same length, to generate the ciphertext, using the XOR function. Though sounds simple, it is the only existing mathematically unbreakable encryption, and thus it provides very long-term message secrecy.

Vernam also patented a "Secret Signaling System" in July 22, 1919. The NSA has called this patent "perhaps one of the most important in the history of cryptography." Also, the US Army 1925 SIGTOT teletype system was based on Vernam's machine encipherment concept.

Vernam cipher is also called an unbreakable cipher, as long as the key is kept secret.
